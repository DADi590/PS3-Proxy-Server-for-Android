- Intial release
- EDIT: Maybe better not to use, since it doesn't have an updates notifier, but it works well anyways.

- Fixed bug of not saving the settings sometimes;
- Updates notifier added;
- Manual updates checker added;
- Instructions screen added;
- Now it's possible to manually write the ps3-updatelist.txt file;
- Colors changed to red, green and yellow on the entire app;
- Update IP added, so when the IP changes for some reason, it's just click there and the server will restart with the new IP.
