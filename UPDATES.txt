File for PS3 Proxy Server for Android to prompt to download and install the updates linked bellow (the same that are on "Releases")
---
Custom update version --> 4.8402
---
1.0 --> https://github.com/DADi590/PS3-Proxy-Server-for-Android/releases/download/v1.0/PS3_Proxy_Server_for_Android_v1.0_-_please_do_not_use.apk
- Intial release
- EDIT: Might be better not to use this version, since it doesn't have an updates notifier, but it works well anyways.
2.0 <-- --> https://github.com/DADi590/PS3-Proxy-Server-for-Android/releases/download/v2.0/PS3_Proxy_Server_for_Android_v2.0.apk
- Fixed bug of not saving the settings sometimes;
- Updates notifier added;
- Manual updates checker added;
- Instructions screen added;
- Now it's possible to manually write the ps3-updatelist.txt file (thanks to zaheer7890 (PSX-Place) for the idea, since I had thought it wouldn't be much needed, so if anyone needed to make a manual file because the automatic one wasn't working, please tell me and I'll add your region - hope all regions are there);
- Colors changed to red, green and yellow on the entire app (was an accident, the change from that green to red, but I think now it looks nicer);
- Update IP added, so when the IP changes for some reason, it's just click there and the server will restart with the new IP.
